## My process

Mobile first approach. Use flexbox and some grid to get the desired effect.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I finally decided to use grid in one of these challenges. I dont think it was entirely nessesary, however it was good practice to implement it. On the other hand I also used flexbox for the same puropose, so it was interesting for me to understand how to achieve a certain layout using two different tools in one project. Im beggining to understand certain use cases where grid would be more applicable - atleast to those who are inclinded to use it. Certainly I see now the combination of the two is where the real magic happens. In addition to all of this, I continue to refine my technique and 'instinct' when it comes to CSS properties and how they behave, and misbehaive for that matter.

### Continued development

I will need to start cleaning up my code as i progress through these challenges.
